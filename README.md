# Shape-polymorphism-

Here in this Shape project. I have basically brished my knowledge in polymorphism anf virtual class.
I have created two pure virtual class here named as Shape and Shape3D. Circle which is a 2D shape
inherits Shape class and returns the area. 

In the same manner the shapes that are 3D inherits Shape3D 
class and returns both volume and Area. In the main I have created two objects, one for Shape and
another for Shape3D. I have used these to objects to access all the functions of other classes
such as Circle, Rectangle, Sqyare, Cylinder, Sphere and cube.
